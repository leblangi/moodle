UdeM Splash, a moodle 2.x theme by Gilles-Philippe Leblanc.

UdeM Splash is a three column flexible width theme.
It can use the new moodle menu dropdowns and the moodle dock.
The users can also change color of the theme dynamically and also have a fullscreen mode.

Some icons used in this theme are from the Fugue icon set by Yusuke Kamiyamane and are freely available at http://code.google.com/p/fugue-icons-src/. 

In addition, inspiration for this theme comes from, in part, previous moodle 2.x themes including Caroline Kennedy's Splash theme. 

Please contact me at gilles-philippe.leblanc@umontreal.ca if you have any questions, concerns or feedback. 

I hope you enjoy this theme and have fun modifying it. If you make any interesting mods of this theme, please let me know!
