Local plugin to list parents of student in a course.

It adds a link under the "participants" link in the course navigation.

In fact, it display users with a specific user role.

This listing is derived from participant list but I had to remove some feature (sorting) to make it work.

PREREQUISIS
-----------
A role that can be assign to user context must exist (ex: parent or mentor role).
For more details about it: http://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Parent_role

INSTALLATION
------------
Just place the content under "local" sub-directory, and go to admin section to complete installation.

Feel free to send me any comments/suggestions
